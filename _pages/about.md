#Yeon-Soo Lim

##Education
- M.S., in Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University (2020.03 ~ )
- B.S., in Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University (2014.03 ~ 2020.02)

##Technical Skills
- Hand-on experience in applying PyTorch, NLP tools (NLTK, etc.) and open libraries (huggingface, fairseq, etc.) for Korean NLP tasks
- Experience in several NLP tasks with Non-autoregressive decoding, dialogue generation, text summarization and dialogue state detection (hate speech detection)
- Python: Skillful, C++: Middle level

##Research Experience
###Korean single and multi-document summary (2020.03 ~ )
- Developed a topic-centric text summarization model with statistical attribute model
- The PPLM is designed for the language model. I changed the PPLM for the text summarization to generate a topic-centric summary.
- Develop a text summarization model using BART
- Post-processing to delete semantically similar summaries using Sentence BERT for multi-document summarization
###Korean dialogue model based on deep learning (2020.03 ~ )
- Research on dialogue generation technology in the form of a single model for multiple domains. Using Continual Learning, a single conversational model can respond to multiple domains.
- I develop a conversation model using seq2seq structure and GPT2 that reflects the keyword score of tokens measured by the keyword extractor
